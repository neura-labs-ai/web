# Engine

The Code library search engine is a web application that allows users to search for code snippets and libraries from various sources. The engine is built using Next.js and Elasticsearch.

## Getting Started

The Code library search engine is currently in development. To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
