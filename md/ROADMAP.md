# Engine Road-map

## The Idea

Create a web app for programmers and library developers to access powerful AI tools and resources.

- Provide personalized recommendations:
  Users can search for a tool for a specific job and results would be returned based on other developers' ratings.
  This could improve the user experience and help them find the right tool more efficiently.

- Create a rating system:
  To make your platform more community-driven,
  you could create a rating system where users can rate different tools based on their experience.
  This could help other users make informed decisions when selecting a tool.

- Integrate with other developer tools:
  Consider integrating your platform with other popular developer tools such as IDEs,
  code editors, and project management tools.
  This could make it easier for users to access your platform and use it alongside their existing tools.

- Offer tutorials and resources:
  Consider offering tutorials and other resources
  to help users learn new skills and stay up-to-date with new technologies.
  This could be in the form of blog posts, videos, or webinars.

- Provide a community forum:
  Consider creating a community forum where users can ask questions, share tips, and collaborate with other developers.
  This could help foster a sense of community around your platform and improve user retention.

- Offer integration with version control systems:
  Consider offering integration with version control systems such as Git or SVN.
  This could make it easier for users to manage their code repositories and discover new tools and workflows that could
  improve their version control process.

## The problems

## The Plan

- Provide intelligent recommendations using machine learning algorithms.
- Use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to improve search functionality.
- Incorporate AI-powered code completion functionality.
- Use AI-powered tools to automate code reviews.
- Use AI-powered debugging tools to help developers quickly identify and fix bugs.
- Use machine learning algorithms to analyze data and provide predictive analytics.

## Web App Pages

Landing page (/): This page should provide an overview of what the web-app does and how it can help programmers.
It should also have a clear call to action for users to sign up or log in.
The landing page could include features such as testimonials,
screenshots or demos of the product, and a list of the key benefits of using the platform.

User dashboard (/dashboard): This page should be the user's central hub for all things related to the web-app.
It should include a personalized view of the user's saved tools, recommendations, and other relevant information.
It could also feature links to various resources, such as user guides, documentation, and support.

Public forms (/forms): This page could be a public forum where community members can discuss various tools, share tips
and tricks, and seek advice from other developers.
It could also be a place where users can suggest new features, report
bugs, or provide feedback to the development team.

Tool search results page (search?q=tool):
This page would display the search results when a user searches for a tool.
It should provide users with clear and relevant information about each tool,
such as ratings, reviews, and pricing information.

Tool detail page (tool/123):
This page should provide users with more detailed information about a particular tool.
It should include features such as screenshots, videos,
and user reviews to help users make informed decisions about whether to use the tool.

User profile page (profile/username):
This page would display the user's profile information,
such as their name, email address, and any other relevant details.
It could also include a list of the user's saved tools, recommendations, and other relevant information.

About us page (/about):
This page would provide users with information about the development team and the company behind the web-app.
It could include features such as bios of the team members,
information about the company's mission and values, and any relevant news or updates.

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup

- [ ] Define the project scope and requirements.
- [ ] Identify and prioritize features and functionality.
- [ ] Determine the technology stack and infrastructure requirements.
- [ ] Set up the development environment and tools.
- [ ] Create a project plan and timeline.
- [ ] Build a prototype or proof of concept to test the initial idea.

## Phase 2: Back-End Development

- [ ] Develop and implement the server-side architecture.
- [ ] Set up the database and data models.
- [ ] Build and integrate the necessary APIs and web services.
