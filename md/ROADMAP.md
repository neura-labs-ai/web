# Engine Road-map

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup

- [ ] Define the scope and requirements of the Code library search engine.
- [ ] Create a project plan and timeline for the development process.

## Phase 2: Front-End Development

- [ ] Design and develop a user interface for the Code library search engine using Next.js.
- [ ] Implement search functionality using Elasticsearch or another search engine technology.
- [ ] Develop a dashboard for authenticated users to manage their account and saved libraries.
- [ ] Implement Github authentication to allow users to sign in using their Github accounts.

## Phase 3: Back-End Development
- [ ] Set up API endpoints to handle requests from the front-end.
- [x] Create a MongoDB database to store and manage your data.
- [ ] Develop web scraping tools to collect code snippets and libraries from various sources.
- [ ] Implement a way to cache code snippets and libraries to reduce the load on the web scraping tools.

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Develop a testing strategy and test the Code library search engine thoroughly.
- [ ] Deploy the Code library search engine to a cloud hosting platform, such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform.
- [ ] Set up continuous integration and deployment using Github Actions or another similar tool.
- [ ] Monitor the performance of the Code library search engine and make any necessary updates or improvements.
